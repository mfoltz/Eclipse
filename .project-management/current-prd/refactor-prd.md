# Product Requirements Document: Refactor Continuation

## Problem Statement
The codebase exhibits inconsistent structure and several build warnings and errors. To maintain long-term stability and clarity, we need systematic refactoring using the best principles outlined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Objectives
- Improve readability and maintainability by applying the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Address build warnings/errors highlighted in the current build output.
- Organize services, utilities, and resources more clearly.
- Introduce unit tests for critical code paths.

## Key Features / Acceptance Criteria
1. **Code Clarity**
   - All classes and methods have explicit responsibilities and XML documentation.
   - Naming follows the conventions in `AGENTS.md`.
2. **Compilation Cleanliness**
   - Builds succeed without errors and with minimal warnings.
3. **Directory Structure**
   - Project files organized logically (e.g., services under `Services/`, utilities under `Utilities/`).
4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests exist for at least major services and data parsers.

## Timeline Estimate
- Planning and design: 1 week
- Refactoring and initial testing: 2 weeks
- Review and polish: 1 week
